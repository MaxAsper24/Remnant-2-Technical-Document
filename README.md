# Technical-Document-R2
My Technical document for freecodeCamp about Remnant 2 builds.
This Project is a general guide for how builds in Remnant 2 are formed and how 
they should be approached. This is a certification project for my HTML certification.
Contains the original files for the project certification as well as a test file for trying responsive design via media queries.
