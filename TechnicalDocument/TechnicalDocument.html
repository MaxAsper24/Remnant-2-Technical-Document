                <p>Remnant 2 is a game that is all about skill, timing, and builds. While both skill and timing are something that can be improved with practice, builds requires a bit more knowledge and patience to pull off. This is because Remnant 2 is at its heart a game that is meant to be replayed over and over to get the proper items and weapons to have the best experience, and the most fun.</p>
                <p>All builds in Remnant 2 revolve around a similar concept, obtain the gear and in game skills available to you to maximize your potential. Whether your goals are to be as tanky and damage resistant as humanly possible, or to deal enough damage to tear through world bosses like paper, there is almost certainly a build for you. Now this isn't a direct guide on any specific builds, but a general overview on how you should approach making a build that feels good to you, and accomplishes the tasks you've set out to do. With that being said, here is some basic information to start you on your journey to becoming an absolute nightmare to all who stand in your way.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Archetypes">
                <header>Archetypes</header>
                <p>The true root (hehe) of any build begins with your archetypes. You can think of Archetypes like a "class" or "role" from other similar games. When you start your game you will be able to choose from four different archetypes (or five if you have the upgraded version of the game). Those are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Medic</li>
                    <li>The Hunter</li>
                    <li>The Challenger</li>
                    <li>The Handler</li>
                    <li>The Gunslinger (This is instantly unlocked with the upgraded game version)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you continue to play the game, you can actually unlock all of the archetypes to switch between as you please, including all of the starter archetypes. At the time of writing this, there are 12 archetypes in total. Those not mentioned before are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Summoner</li>
                    <li>The Alchemist</li>
                    <li>The Engineer</li>
                    <li>The Invader</li>
                    <li>The Explorer</li>
                    <li>The Ritualist</li>
                    <li>The Archon</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Choosing the proper archetype for your build is paramount to your success. It's important to remember that once you gain 15 trait points by finding tome's of knowledge, or defeating bosses, you can equip 2 archetypes at once. One being your prime, the other being your secondary. Having an archetype in the prime slot (the left one) will activate its prime perk, which is essentially the perk that will determine the unique mechanic connected with that archetype. For example, here is the prime perk for the Medic archetype.</p>
                 <div class="narrow"><code>Regenerator:After restoring 350 Total Health to allies, regain a spent Relic charge. Resting or Respawning at a Worldstone resets healing accumulation. Each additional player increases the healing requirement by 50%.</code></div>
                 <p>Now that you know what archetypes there are, here are a few different examples of combinations that might work well together for you. These are in no particular prime/secondary order, or meta ranking.</p>
                 <div class="narrow"><code>Hunter/Gunslinger: This combination has a high crit chance and large amounts of ranged weapon damage.</code></div>
                 <div class="narrow"><code>Medic/Challenger: With increased healing, relic regeneration, and extra armor efficiency, this combination will make you nearly impossible to fell.</code></div>
                 <div class="narrow"><code>Summoner/Handler: Never feel lonely with your trusty root summons and German Shepherd by your side. Sit back and relax while your best friends take the brunt of the aggro and deal very respectable damage at the same time.</code></div>
                <div class="narrow">While these suggestions are quite solid and very fun depending on the person, remember that you need to try things out to see what works for you. Don't forget, you're here to have fun!</div>

            <section class="main-section" id="Long_Guns">
                <header>Long Guns</header>
                <p>Long guns are your primary source of damage for almost all builds, with a few exceptions. But for the sake of simplicity, we'll assume you're going to focus on the long gun. These can range from light machine guns with insanely fast fire rates, to one shot sniper rifles with enough kick to put any enemy on their back, to strange and interesting boss weapons that can seemingly distort reality.</p>
                <p>All weapons in Remnant 2 come from three different places. Either you can purchase them from Brabus at Ward 13, find them out in the world in their completed state, or have McCabe craft them in Ward 13 from their base materials that you can obtain from either bosses, events, or unique interactions.</p>
                <p>To show you what that means, here are two examples of weapons obtained through different means:</p>
                <div class="gun-picture"><figure><img src="https://remnant2.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Remnant-2/blackmaw_ar_47_long_gun_remnant2_wiki_guide_300px.png" alt="Blackmaw AR-47 Long Gun">
                    <figcaption><code>Blackmaw AR-47</code></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <div class="narrow"><p>The Blackmaw AR-47 is an assault rifle with decent fire rate, accuracy, and damage. It is a powerful tool useful for any situation and can be obtained from the moment you begin playing. It is the starter weapon for the Handler archetype, and if you chose a different starting archetype than the Handler, it can be purchased from Brabus in Ward 13 for 1,500 scrap.</p>
                </div>
                <figure><img src="https://remnant2.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Remnant-2/nightfall_long_gun_remnant2_wiki_guide_300px.png" alt="Nightfall Long Gun"><figcaption><code>Nightfall</code></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <div class="narrow"><p>Nightfall is a boss weapon that can be crafted at McCabe in Ward 13 after defeating the world boss of Losomn, The Nightweaver. It is a semi-automatic weapon that shoots high damage projectiles. It's built in weapon mod turns the weapon fully automatic,increases your move speed, and gives you infinite ammo reserves for the duration.</p></div>
