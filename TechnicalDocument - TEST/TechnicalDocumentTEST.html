                <p>Remnant 2 is a game that is all about skill, timing, and builds. While both skill and timing are something that can be improved with practice, builds requires a bit more knowledge and patience to pull off. This is because Remnant 2 is at its heart a game that is meant to be replayed over and over to get the proper items and weapons to have the best experience, and the most fun.</p>
                <p>All builds in Remnant 2 revolve around a similar concept, obtain the gear and in game skills available to you to maximize your potential. Whether your goals are to be as tanky and damage resistant as humanly possible, or to deal enough damage to tear through world bosses like paper, there is almost certainly a build for you. Now this isn't a direct guide on any specific builds, but a general overview on how you should approach making a build that feels good to you, and accomplishes the tasks you've set out to do. With that being said, here is some basic information to start you on your journey to becoming an absolute nightmare to all who stand in your way.</p>
                <p ><code>Spoiler Warning: This Article will contain some spoilers for content that you may or may not have seen yet in the game. Continue at your own risk!</code></p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Archetypes">
                <header>Archetypes</header>
                <p>The true root (hehe) of any build begins with your archetypes. You can think of Archetypes like a "class" or "role" from other similar games. When you start your game you will be able to choose from four different archetypes (or five if you have the upgraded version of the game). Those are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Medic</li>
                    <li>The Hunter</li>
                    <li>The Challenger</li>
                    <li>The Handler</li>
                    <li>The Gunslinger (This is instantly unlocked with the upgraded game version)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you continue to play the game, you can actually unlock all of the archetypes to switch between as you please, including all of the starter archetypes. At the time of writing this, there are 12 archetypes in total. Those not mentioned before are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Summoner</li>
                    <li>The Alchemist</li>
                    <li>The Engineer</li>
                    <li>The Invader</li>
                    <li>The Explorer</li>
                    <li>The Ritualist</li>
                    <li>The Archon</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Choosing the proper archetype for your build is paramount to your success. It's important to remember that once you gain 15 trait points by finding tome's of knowledge, or defeating bosses, you can equip 2 archetypes at once. One being your prime, the other being your secondary. Having an archetype in the prime slot (the left one) will activate its prime perk, which is essentially the perk that will determine the unique mechanic connected with that archetype. For example, here is the prime perk for the Medic archetype.</p>
                 <div><code>Regenerator:After restoring 350 Total Health to allies, regain a spent Relic charge. Resting or Respawning at a Worldstone resets healing accumulation. Each additional player increases the healing requirement by 50%.</code></div>
                 <p>Now that you know what archetypes there are, here are a few different examples of combinations that might work well together for you. These are in no particular prime/secondary order, or meta ranking.</p>
                 <div><code>Hunter/Gunslinger: This combination has a high crit chance and large amounts of ranged weapon damage.</code></div>
                 <div><code>Medic/Challenger: With increased healing, relic regeneration, and extra armor efficiency, this combination will make you nearly impossible to fell.</code></div>
                 <div><code>Summoner/Handler: Never feel lonely with your trusty root summons and German Shepherd by your side. Sit back and relax while your best friends take the brunt of the aggro and deal very respectable damage at the same time.</code></div>
                <p>While these suggestions are quite solid and very fun depending on the person, remember that you need to try things out to see what works for you. Don't forget, you're here to have fun!</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Long_Guns">
                <header>Long Guns</header>
                <p>Long guns are your primary source of damage for almost all builds, with a few exceptions. But for the sake of simplicity, we'll assume you're going to focus on the long gun. These can range from light machine guns with insanely fast fire rates, to one shot sniper rifles with enough kick to put any enemy on their back, to strange and interesting boss weapons that can seemingly distort reality.</p>
                <p>All weapons in Remnant 2 come from three different places. Either you can purchase them from Brabus at Ward 13, find them out in the world in their completed state, or have McCabe craft them in Ward 13 from their base materials that you can obtain from either bosses, events, or unique interactions.</p>
                <p>To show you what that means, here are two examples of weapons obtained through different means:</p>
                <div><p>The Blackmaw AR-47 is an assault rifle with decent fire rate, accuracy, and damage. It is a powerful tool useful for any situation and can be obtained from the moment you begin playing. It is the starter weapon for the Handler archetype, and if you chose a different starting archetype than the Handler, it can be purchased from Brabus in Ward 13 for 1,500 scrap.</p>
                </div>
                <div><p>Nightfall is a boss weapon that can be crafted at McCabe in Ward 13 after defeating the world boss of Losomn, The Nightweaver. It is a semi-automatic weapon that shoots high damage projectiles. It's built in weapon mod turns the weapon fully automatic,increases your move speed, and gives you infinite ammo reserves for the duration.</p></div>
                </div>
                <p>When you do choose your long gun, it's important to try and remember the long term goals for your build. Are you looking consistent and reliable damage to compliment your skills and mods; or are you looking for a centerpiece weapon that will make the most of your high crit chance and ranged potential? With so many options it can seem impossible, but remember to experiment, because no one weapon will only work on one build.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Hand_Guns">
                <header>Hand Guns</header>
                <p>Almost certainly the most used item in your kit in Remnant 2 will be your hand gun. You will find more ammo for this than for your long gun, and as such will most likely be more familiar with it. They are obtained the same way as long guns, that being crafted, found, or bought.</p>
                <p>While some builds will use this as more of a utility than large source of damage, that is not always true. Due to early game restrictions on ammo pickups, generation, and efficiency, you will find yourself running low quite frequently. This means you will find yourself running back to crystals often just to fill up. It is important to not understate the importance of hand guns in any and all builds, especially in the early game.</p>
                <p>Here are some examples of hand guns that you can find in Remnant 2:</p>
                    <div><p>The Tech 22 hand gun boasts an incredible fire rate and average damage. This coupled with a decent accuracy rating means it is always a solid choice. This is the starter pistol for the Handler archetype and can also be purchased from Brabus at Ward 13.</p></div>
                    <div><p>Nebula is an atypical hand gun that shoots a consistent and short range cloud of acid that deals small ticks of damage that will persist after releasing the trigger, applying the corroded effect. It as a build in mod that shoots a swarm of nano bots that repeatedly attacks enemies and follows them around. It can be obtained by defeating the physical form of Tal Ratha in the world of N'Erud.</p></div>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Melee_Weapons">
                <header>Melee Weapons</header>
                <p>When enemies get a little too close for comfort, and your guns just aren't cutting it, you can always rely on your trusty melee weapon. Melee weapons in Remannt 2 are upgradeable, just like long guns and hand guns, and each have a unique move set or special ability attached. Whether it is a katana with swift strikes, or a massive two handed hammer that packs a punch, each are unique and just as interesting as any other part of the game.</p>
                <p>Melee weapons might sometimes be your final course of action against a boss that has seemingly absorbed all of your ammunition and just won't die. To ensure your success, you need a trusted and effective tool ready at a moments notice to save you from certain death.</p>
                <p>There are some builds that focus primarily on their close range damage, specifically melee. I would consider these to be quite niche, and after considering the amount of gear, armor, and traits you will need, quite difficult to pull off. This is not to say you shouldn't do a melee build if that is what sounds fun to you, but to understand the risks and the challenges you will face moving forward with it.</p>
                <p>Something important to remember about attacking with melee is that it does <strong>NOT</strong> take stamina to swing your weapon. It <strong>WILL</strong> however slow down your stamina regeneration for the duration of the attack. So take that into account when deciding what you want to take with you on your journeys.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Jewelry">
                <header>Jewelry</header>
                <p>In my opinion, the most important part of your build, beside from your archetype, is going to be your jewelry. It might sound strange, but choosing the proper jewelry for your build will give you the largest stat changes, and sometimes even completely alter how basic functions of the game work.</p>
                <p>Remnant 2 gives the player five slots for jewelry.One necklace and four rings can be worn at any given time. All of these can only be found in the world when exploring, or bought from vendors in Ward 13 and beyond. After completing in game challenges or milestones, some vendors will suddenly carry new necklaces or rings. The game won't tell you though when these have been accomplished, so make sure you check their stock often!</p>
                <p>Instead of getting into details, This guide will focus more on general concepts, as stated before. Following that concept, you might want to consider Jewelry that works well together or compliments the build you are working towards. Some examples would be rings that increase your elemental damage, or a necklace that boosts your damage after every kill, stacking to a certain amount. One specific ring, The Black Cat Band, can even give you a second chance after death every few minutes! While many rings will be quite useless to you in your current build, be sure to be somewhat familiar with them as they may become incredibly useful later on.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Relics">
                <header>Relics</header>
                <p>If you are familiar with similar styles of games, you might recognize that your healing is not infinite. You have a limited number of relic uses. What makes Remnant 2 a unique game in this aspect however, is that you are not locked into just one relic. There are actually many relics to be found out on your adventure. Some can be crafted, some can be bought, and others are hidden behind puzzles or optional dungeons.</p>
                <p>What you think of as your relic, if you have played other games of the genre, might be a one use consumable with large healing properties that reset on death or worldstone activation. Which in the case of the dragon heart is actually true. Though as mentioned before, this is far from the only relic in the game. Some relics heal over time. Some heal you when you dodge attacks. Some even drain your life in exchange for more power in a fight. But if you're like me, you'll find a favorite, and tend to stick with it. These relics can sometimes be really important to the function of builds, but mostly just serve the purpose of making sure you can heal/protect yourself over the course of a dungeon or boss fight. So find one you like and try to run with it.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Weapon_Mods">
                <header>Weapon Mods</header>
                <p>Weapon mods are powerful abilities that are attacked to your weapons that you can charge by doing damage. You will charge the mod connected to the equipped weapon the most, and give small amounts of mod energy to your non-equip weapon.</p>
                <p>Some mods are one use large doses of damage. Others are duration based that alter the damage type and fire rate of the gun. While some mods can actually summon creature to do the damage themselves. Weapon mods will be one of two types: build into a boss or unique weapon; or a standalone that lets you move it between guns at will. If a gun has a built in mod, then you <strong>CANNOT</strong> remove it. It is build into the identity of the gun. Other weapons, such as the Blackmaw AR-47, have an empty slot attached, where you can insert and remove mods whenever you please. Do remember though that whenever you remove or insert a mod into a weapon, it will reset the charge of the mod. So be careful when deciding what mods to attach before a boss, as changing them mid-fight might be very unwise.</p>
                <p>Understanding the timing, charge rate, and utility of some mods will make you a far better player than you were before, as they can help save ammo, life, and stress when used properly.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Mutators">
                <header>Mutators</header>
                <p>The last piece of information we're going to cover here is mutators. Mutators can be quite tricky to understand sometimes so it's important to read them carefully and understand what direction your trying to go before leveling them up. Many of the mutators in the game are pretty self explanatory when looking at them, and as such can add flat value when you equip them to your guns or melee weapon. Some of them however, might be slightly harder to grasp or see the long term vision.</p>
                <p>Mutators are special augments to weapons, both melee and guns, that will enhance their abilities. While confusing, it should be noted that having the correct mutator leveled up and equipped on the right weapon will take your build to the next level. Some might increase damage done to bleeding enemies, or give you mod power back after using the equipped mod, or even letting you slow enemies down around you when you use your mods. There are very many to collect over the course of playing Remnant 2, so be on the lookout for one that fits your desired build.</p>
                <p>Mutators can be leveled up by collecting corrupted lumenite crystals. Similar to regular lumenite, these drop from strong enemies that roam the lands beyond Ward 13. Different from regular lumenite, however, is the fact that these enemies glow bright red and carry a healthbar of theirs atop the screen, as well as laden with modifiers. These modifiers are what give these so called "abberations" their uniquity and power. While some of these enemies can be found in static locations in certain map tiles, others will spawn on top of you randomly while journeying. This lack of predictablility and randomized modifiers are what really make these enemies very hard to deal with.</p>
                <p>Some of the modifiers you might see on these abberations could include displacer, which periodically transports the player to a random location near the enemy. Or cubes, which will summon massive cubes of energy to swirl around them and deal massive damage to players caught in its area while not dodging. There is a long list of modifiers, so be ready for anything.</p>
                <p>Once you defeat an abberations, you will obtain either a new mutator, and/or corrupted lumenite. This means that to upgrade your mutators, you're going to have to do some grinding. It takes quite a lot of corrupted lumenite and scrap to upgrage the mutators to full. Once at level ten, mutators will take on a new ability that will also apply, meaning it's usually better to spend your resources on a few at a time, rather than put one level into all of them.</p>

                <header>Summary</header>
                <p>I hope that reading is guide gave you some small insight into making a Remnant 2 build that you both enjoy, and have great success with. Remnant 2 is a punishing game that can take some gettin used to, and feel almost impossible if you don't approach it with a proper mindset and a good build. If you are still lost or having difficulty with the game, I urge you to be patient, give it some time, and keep trying. Rome wasn't built in a day, and I guarantee your character won't be either. With all that being said, go have some fun, wanderer!</p>
